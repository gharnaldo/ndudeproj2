# Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Project Description

This Project will allow Sparkify Startup analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. They will be able to know what songs users are listening to based on their data, which resides in a directory of CSV files.

The project was made in a jupyter notebook with the necessary scripts to create a database in Apache Cassandra and the necessary queries on song play data to answer the questions.
